# Customer-Segmentation



The dataset comprises three pivotal features crucial for credit card segmentation:

BALANCE: Represents the remaining balance in the credit card holders' accounts.

PURCHASES: Signifies the total amount spent from the credit card holders' accounts.

CREDIT_LIMIT: Denotes the credit card limit assigned to each individual.

These features offer comprehensive insights into the purchasing behavior, account balances, and credit limits of credit card holders. Utilizing this information, we can effectively group individuals into clusters, facilitating a deeper understanding of their financial profiles and aiding in the segmentation process.


Credit card cluster analysis means grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many more financial factors. Such clustering analysis helps businesses find their potential customers and many more marketing strategies.
